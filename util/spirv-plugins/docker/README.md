This folder creates a docker container pre-configured for compiling RenderDoc's SPIR-V plugins with the oldest possible distribution, for maximum compatibility of the binary build.

It doesn't contain anything RenderDoc-specific, apart from being tailored to its dependencies. It depends on renderdoc-build from the normal build scripts.
